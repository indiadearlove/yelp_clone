# Yelp

## Week 9 Project

A clone of yelp.

## Technologies Used:

* Ruby on Rails
* HTML
* CSS

## Goals:

* Creating Rails applications
* The structure of Rails apps (MVC, the router, helpers)
* TDD in Rails, with RSpec & Capybara
* Associations
* Validations
* AJAX in Railse

## Specifications to be Completed:

- Visitors can create new restaurants using a form, specifying a name and rating
- Restaurants can be edited and deleted
- Visitors can leave reviews for restaurants, providing a numerical score (1-5) and a comment about their experience
- The restaurants listings page should display all the reviews, along with the average rating of each restaurant
- [Validations](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/walkthroughs/validations.md) should be in place for the restaurant and review forms - restaurants must be given a name and rating, reviews must be given a rating from 1-5 (comment is optional)
* Users can register/login
* A user must be logged in to create restaurants
* Users can only edit/delete restaurants **which they've created**
* Users can only leave **one review per restaurant**
* Users can delete their own reviews
* Some indication should be given on the page (as part of the layout) whether the user is currently logged in, along with links to the available actions (i.e. Logout/Edit account is signed in, otherwise Sign In/Sign Up)
* The email address of the reviewer should be displayed as part of the review
* *Optional* - Users can't review a restaurant which they created
* Currently, when writing a review, we have to go to a separate page and trigger a page refresh. Migrate the functionality to happen asynchronously with AJAX. We'll also have to set up [Poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) to enable us to run JS-enabled tests.
* Create a helper method to allow ratings and average ratings to be displayed as stars (e.g.) rather than numbers
* Use CSS to enhance the overall design of the site
* Refactor your more complex views to use partials
* *Optional* - Add the ability for users to add an image to a restaurant, by pointing to an external image URL
